# Tell-Time-VBS

A VBScript to use in conjunction with Windows Task Scheduler to have the computer tell the time every 15 minutes using SAPI but to **not interrupt** when Zoom or Microsoft Teams is running. Current text for text-to-speech conversion is written in French (as my computer's default language). 

Adapted code from this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42187322/vbscript-loop-tell-time-every-15-minutes) and [this forum post](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/066998e8-3576-4dbc-9dcb-227640c946f4/check-if-a-program-is-running-or-not-using-vbscipt?forum=ITCG). Also, my open StackOverflow question is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68925673/7870390).
